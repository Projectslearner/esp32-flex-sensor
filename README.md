This is an auto-generated README file.# ESP32 Flex Sensor Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to read values from a flex sensor. Flex sensors are commonly used to measure bending or flexing in various applications such as wearable devices, robotics, and interactive art projects.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Flex Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block diagram


## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Flex Sensor to ESP32:**
   - Connect one end of the flex sensor to a 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
   - Connect the other end of the flex sensor to the analog input pin 34 on the ESP32.
   - Place a pull-down resistor (e.g., 10kŒ©) between the analog input pin and GND to ensure stable readings.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 using `Serial.begin()`.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog value from the flex sensor using `analogRead(flexSensorPin)`.
     - Print the flex sensor value to the Serial Monitor.
     - Add a delay of 500 milliseconds to avoid spamming the Serial Monitor.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor according to the specific range of motion you intend to measure.
   - **Power Supply:** Ensure the sensor has a stable power supply for accurate readings.
   - **Environmental Factors:** Be aware of environmental factors that might affect the sensor‚Äôs performance, such as temperature and humidity.

## Applications
- **Wearable Devices:** Measure bending or flexing in wearable technology.
- **Robotics:** Monitor joint movements or deformations in robotic components.
- **Interactive Art Projects:** Create art installations that respond to bending or flexing movements.

## Notes
- **Sensor Output:** The flex sensor provides an analog output that varies with the amount of bending or flexing.
- **Data Interpretation:** The raw analog values can be further processed or mapped to meaningful units if necessary.
